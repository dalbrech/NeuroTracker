Have .tif files from recorded experiments in one folder
Open ImageJ > Plugins > Macros > NeuronTracking [t]
Select folder with videos to analyze
Identify recording set that is ideal for analysis
Find video start (closest to top of folder), 15
Find video end (closest to bottom of folder), 24
Select neuron(s) on second frame of video file that opens
Keep track of which animal is which chosen (i.e. do WT then exper.)
Play with brightness/contrast in imageJ and threshold to identify neurons
Select neruons with cross hairs
Right click to start progam
Allow program to run each frame for each neuron image
If tracking dot goes off desired neuron, pause (SPACE), rewind, realign
May need to adjust threshold to be more clear for that neuron
Repeat for each worm, allow to finish.

When complete or paused, find text files in desired folder and open MATLAB
Locate these files and see MATLAB notes
